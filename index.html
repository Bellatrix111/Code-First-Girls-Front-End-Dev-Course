            Budō - a philosophy and a way of life that utilizes Martial Arts (Bujutsu) as a means of self-improvement </header>
        <h1>The inner way of the Samurai - developing Budō</h1>

        <main> 
            <p>
                Budō is a compound of the root bu (武:ぶ), meaning "war" or "martial"; and dō (道:どう; dào in Chinese), 
                meaning "path" or "way" (including the ancient Indic Dharmic and Buddhist conception of "path", 
                or mārga in Sanskrit). Budō is the idea of formulating propositions, subjecting them to philosophical 
                critique and then following a "path" to realize them. Dō signifies a "way of life". Dō in the Japanese 
                context is an experiential term in the sense that practice (the way of life) is the norm to verify the 
                validity of the discipline cultivated through a given art form. Modern budō has no external enemy, 
                only the internal one: my ego that must be fought.
            </p>

            <p>
                Similarly to budō, bujutsu is a compound of the roots bu (武), and jutsu (術:じゅつ), meaning technique. 
                Thus, budō is translated as "martial way", or "the way of war" while bujutsu is translated as 
                "science of war" or "martial craft." However, both budō and bujutsu are used interchangeably in 
                English with the term "martial arts". Budo and bujutsu have quite a delicate difference; whereas 
                bujutsu only gives attention to the physical part of fighting (how to best defeat an enemy), budo 
                also gives attention to the mind and how one should develop oneself.
