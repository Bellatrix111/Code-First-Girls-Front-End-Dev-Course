        <h1> General information about Samurais</h1>

        <main>
            <p> The samurai (or bushi) were the warriors of premodern Japan. 
                They later made up the ruling military class which eventually became the highest ranking social caste of the Edo Period (1603-1867). 
                Samurai employed a range of weapons such as bows and arrows, spears and guns, but their main weapon and symbol was the sword.

                Samurai were supposed to lead their lives according to the ethic code of bushido ("the way of the warrior"). 
                Strongly Confucian in nature, bushido stressed concepts such as loyalty to one's master, self discipline and respectful, ethical behavior. 
                Many samurai were also drawn to the teachings and practices of Zen Buddhism.

                In Japanese, they are usually referred to as bushi (武士, [bɯ.ɕi]), meaning 'warrior', or buke (武家), meaning 'military family'. 
                According to translator William Scott Wilson: "In Chinese, the character 侍 was originally a verb meaning 'to wait upon', 'accompany persons' 
                in the upper ranks of society, and this is also true of the original term in Japanese, saburau. 

                By the end of the 12th century, samurai became almost entirely synonymous with bushi, and the word was closely associated with the middle and 
                upper echelons of the warrior class. 
                The samurai were usually associated with a clan and their lord, and were trained as officers in military tactics and grand strategy. 
                While the samurai numbered less than 10% of then Japan's population,their teachings can still be found today in both 
                everyday life and in modern Japanese martial arts.

                            He was called to an audience with Oda Nobunaga, the most powerful warlord of the day, who was so stunned by his appearance 
                            that he had him strip to the waist and rub his skin to prove he wasn't colored with ink.
                            Nobunaga was so impressed by Yasuke's strength and size—recorded as roughly 188 centimeters (6ft 2in) tall—that he made him 
                            his personal retainer and bodyguard. In 1581, Yasuke was elevated to the rank of samurai and stationed at Azuchi Castle, 
                            Nobunaga's crowning glory, where he dined with the warlord and functioned as his personal sword bearer.
